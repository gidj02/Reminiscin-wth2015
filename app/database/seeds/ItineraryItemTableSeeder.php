                            Angono is home to many of the country?s great artists
                            Angono, Rizal is a quiet little town an hour away from Manila. It seems like an ordinary town with a plaza and busy market, but nothing is ordinary about Angono. It is home to many of the country?s finest artists. Maybe it?s the rugged and hilly landscapes or sleepy fishing villages that inspired these painters. But why is Marikina popular for shoes and Bulacan for sweets? Maybe it?s just the way it is. It seemed that when God was showering artistic talent in the country, a lot of it went to the artists of Angono
                            Angono lies between Laguna Lake and the foot-hills of the Sierra Madre, some 30 kilometers from Manila, a town whose folk hero, the late National Artist Carlos ?Botong? Francisco, was a benign hippie and the most famous Filipino muralist.
                            Botong Francisco was one of the leaders of the modern art movement in the Philippines. He reveled in and recorded Philippine history, legends, small-town folkways and small-town sights. Using the evocative force of line, shape and color, he captured on canvas the grace, vi-vacity and resilience of the Filipino.
                            Little Angono is the country?s artists haven and home to the late veteran artist Nemiranda, Jose ?Pitok? Blanco and Perdigon Vocalan. It is also the hometown of the politician-parliamentarian Arturo M. Tolentino and of mu-sicman Lucio San Pedro, the eminent Filipino composer and UP professor emeritus and con-ductor of the outstanding Banda Angono, the town?s brass band which dates back to the horse-and-buggy days.
                            The presence of two art groups ? the An-gono Artists Association and the Angono Atel-iers Association serves to inspire young and emerging visual artists, ensuring the continuity of this town?s artistic heritage.
                            Who knows what some disciple of Botong?s, perhaps one of those unknown factory hands who paint on Sundays, will someday sur-prise us with.
                            But as for now, the life-enhancing gift of the Angono painters is their heart-warming vision of the world not as a wasteland but as a wonderland.
                            Angono has been known as the cradle of the arts or the fountain of talents. Three National Artists had bloomed in this quiet little town. They are Botong, San Pedro and Manansala.
                            Today?s renown artists like the Blanco?s family and Nemiranda and his children command a big influence in the growing art populace of Angono.
                            Other known artists in Angono are Vicente Reyes, Salvador Juban, Bobet Andres, Weweng Unidad, Lito Balagtas, Cesar T. Hernandez et. al. The Nemiranda Arthouse and the Blanco Museum are two of the most well known Art Museum in Angono that are habitat of art connoisseurs and tourists.
                            How did Angono get into the arts? The Angono Petroglyphs, which was discovered in the 60s, was found to have etched drawings on the rock surface of the cave in the mountain forest of Angono.
                            Archeologist from the National Museum confirmed that the age of the rock art drawings based on their studies of rock sedimentation was 3,000 years-old.
                            Tandang Juancho or Juan Senson, the grand old man of art in Angono, who lived in the 19th century, had a vast collections of mostly religious painting and sculptures which are now in the hands of his relatives.
                            National Artist Botong Francisco created a magnificent influenced in the art scene particularly in Angono.
                            What is most striking in the art development of Angono is the presence of the Angono Ateliers Association. Conceived in 1975, the association has become a jumping board of many would be artists and artists alike.

                            Nemiranda Arthouse and Atelier Gallerie

                            The Arthouse filling up the whole 1,012 square meters lot (one block) is the product of Nemirandas natural wit and ingenuity, all poured into transforming Angonos indigenous and recycled materilas like bamboo, nipa, sawali, abacca, old wood as well as its artifacts into this function art. Like a labyrinth, the Arthouse is an environment-friendly architecture concept where trees, birds and ornament plants play a major role. It has become the venue for countless art lessons, sysposia, art competitions, exhibitions and other complimentary activities primarily for the artists of Rizal, making it a credible witness to Nemirandas commitment to elevate the province into an Artists Village. A wide collection of the artists paintings masterfully implying figurative realism in the artworks portraying rural life and folkloric art is on display.

                            Tiamson Art Gallerie

                            A painter, a musician and transmedia artist all rolled into one - this is the young Orville Tiamson. His style ranges from the conventional to new age. Orville Tiamson?s journey began with an ASEAN scholarship grant in 1987, later collaborating with the Manila Art Circle of the Cultural Center of the Philippines. Swinging from music to painting, Orville tried to capture both genres but in 1992, he realized that he needed to focus more on his painting. His father, Dominador Tiamson was also a painter, only more traditional. The artist?s cubist style is very striking, similar to the carved linear drawings of Manansala, with a modern twist. Orville explored Philippine culture, depicting scenes such as the market place and typical barrio life, but using modern cubist style.

                            Blanco Art Gallery

                            The museum displays the incredibly life-like paintings of the most famous family of painters in the country. Headed by renowned artist Jose ?Pitok? V. Blanco, all seven children employ their father?s painting style. Breaking away from the Botong Francisco tradition, the Blanco family paintings are very natural or closer to reality. Compared to the vibrant colors of the Botong-inspired paintings, the Blancos often use brown tones to effect a more somber depiction of reality. It is also interesting to note that Pitok Blanco?s wife and children are often the subject of his works, whether they are fleeing an Angono fire, are in deep prayer, or as infant angels surrounding Christ. Paintings portraying rural life outdoors are more colorful, each done with painstaking detail.

                            One of the most prolific and talented students of the late National Artist Carlos ?Botong? Francisco, Vicente Reyes is one of Angono,s pride, as proven by his collection of paintings where the highest principle of the art of painting is almost achieved. Doubtless, his outstanding works a depiction of various typical human life and activities, contributed much to the prestige of the town as ?An Artist?s Paradise.?

                            HERNANDEZ STUDIO

                            FROM the yard of Cesar T. Hernandezs studio, located in Angono Hi-Way. After a few knocks on the door, the masculine, good-looking and gentle artist appears with a smile and welcomes visitors. His wife and children exude a shy but neverthelesss equally warm aura. Such gestures promise a pleasant visit and viewing of the obras of one of Angonos maestros.
                            The artist shows his recent works in oil. One is Carlos V. Francisco-inspired and still awaits finishing touches from Hernandez in the next few days. He beams with pride as he narrates about his past encounters with his townmate who became a National Artist-a prime model for all Angono-based painters, young and veteran alike. As a boy, Hernandez used to visit Botong Franciscos studio and watched the painter at work. He admits that those visits must have inspired him in becoming an artist, too.
                            Like most Angono artists, Hernandezs subject includes the biblical, the mythical and the folk. The last, especially, is a world the artist knows by heart, being a farmers son who grew up in the pastoral and bayside town. Angono is much urbanized now but Hernandez remembers communal life and its uplifting effect on an artists vision and soul. Hernandezs style ranges from the early "realistic" to the more recent "conservative-imaginative realism in transparent cubism."

                            Rizal is the province of choice and a definite tourist destination particularly in the field of arts and crafts. It is known as the home of recognized and national artists and musicians.

                            Angono Ateliers Gallery

                            Artists from the Four Corners of Angono joined the Ateliers in 1975 for the pure and simple reason of personal enhancement. A purely self-serving motive that contributee to the split of the Association in 1977. However, as they started all over again, they learned new insights concepts, each one learned from one another. They grew mentally, emotionally and professionally, leaving their prima donna egocentric attitudes.
                            The Angono Ateliers Association is presently an active component of the Rizal Artist Federation, an art guild which Nemiranda was one or the founders. Ateliers who are qualified enough are made member of the Philippine Association of Figure Artists (PAFA); a band of recognized artists in the field of painting and sculpture. Because of the figurative nature of the Angono Ateliers art, the group has been very instrumental to the PAFA cause in developing the human figure as the ultimate subject.

                            Angono and Binangonan Petroglyphs
                            A recent archeological breakthrough of the 90s is the discovery of ancient petroglyphs in the mountainside of Angono and Binangonan. The petroglyphs were validated by the National Museum, the UNESCO and KOMOS as one of the oldest in the Asia-Pacific Region. They can be traced back to the third millennium, B.C. It has been declared as aheritage site. The Deaprtment of Tourism in coordination with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, is now engaged in the development of the site, the protection of the walls from damaged caused by man the elements, and the construction of viewing and rest areas.

                            When I alighted the tricycle, I was worried that the Forest Park might be closed because the old lady that I met at the entrance told me that there was a council meeting. She also asked if I was there for a photo shoot and I replied that I was just touring around. I also asked if there was an entrance fee as it was stated on the sign outside but she told me there was no need for me to pay.It was such a treat for me to talk to the old lady (I didn’t get her name) because she told me a little about the park and that there were steps at the back. She also told me how many steps there were and according to the kids who play there, it’s 77 steps.When I got to the end of the steps, it took me to a road. It was so quiet up there. The old lady mentioned to me that there was a retreat house at the end of the road. But I didn’t go that far for fear that I’d get even more lost. So while the retreat house was up, I went down the road to go back to the entrance of the park. I went back in and had a little chat again with the old lady and walked around for a bit before leaving. I went home feeling really good about myself because I gained a bit of confidence while asking for directions. I took the tricycle back to the plaza for P10 and waited for an FX by the main road. Good thing I asked the FX driver earlier that day on where to wait unless I would’ve been lost. I spent a total of P342 going there and home. Not bad. The people were so accommodating and I’m glad that nothing bad happened to me. Next adventure, I’m dragging someone along.

                            It was my first adventure of the year and I think l learned more about art than in one of my history art classes during college (or maybe because this interested me more than listening to my professor). I really think that a trip to Angono would be a good requirement for art students. But better late than never for me.',

                           While the Wawa River cuts through the primeval rock after the thousand-year process of erosion to form the majestic limestone walls, there is also the local folklore which tells that the Montalban Gorge was created by the mighty Bernardo Carpio.

                          There are several versions about the story of Bernardo Carpio. One version tells about Bernardo as a love child of Infanta Jimena and Don Sancho Diaz. When the forbidden love affair between his sister Infanta and political rival Sancho was discovered by the King Alfonso, he ordered the imprisonment of Infanta and the murder of Sancho.

                          The young Bernardo was able to escape the furious King Alfonso only to be discovered later. But the boy has grown as a giant. The cruel king wanted Bernardo to suffer the same fate as with his parents so he ordered a shaman to have him locked-up until he meets his death deep within the hallows of the mountain in Montalban. The shaman was able to lure Bernardo into the trapped. It is said that whenever an earthquake occurs, it is caused by Bernardo trying to escape from the bowels of the mountain.

                          But another version of the legend revealed that Bernardo broke free by successfully pushing the grinding mountains apart. Water gushed out from the other side of the mountain which formed the river channels of the San Mateo and Marikina. Below the narrow gap between the amazing limestone mountains, Wawa Dam was constructed by the American in 1909 as the primary water source for Manila. 

                          Although we have travelled a lot around the country and have been living in San Mateo Rizal for five years, we ashamedly admit that we have paid little attention to our town’s next door neighbor –Montalban (now Rodriguez). One of Montalban’s attractions is Wawa Dam and we were surprised to discover that it only took us less than 20 minutes to get there from our home.

                          Traveling to Wawa Dam took us to an easy drive across the well-paved roads of San Mateo and then to the mountain road of Rodriguez until we reached, literally the end of the road at Barangay San Rafael.Although we have travelled a lot around the country and have been living in San Mateo Rizal for five years, we ashamedly admit that we have paid little attention to our town’s next door neighbor –Montalban (now Rodriguez).

                          Traveling to Wawa Dam took us to an easy drive across the well-paved roads of San Mateo and then to the mountain road of Rodriguez until we reached, literally the end of the road at Barangay San Rafael.Where the road ended, the hiking began. The hike to Wawa Dam involved us walking on a rocky ascending trail with steep drop-offs on one side and bamboo and nipa houses on the other. These dwellings along the sides of the trail made brisk business by selling turon and samalamig to hikers.

                          As the winding mountain trail became narrower, we could see from one side the steep slope and the running river further enhanced by huge white boulders where the locals have built makeshift huts of bamboo and nipa that tourists and campers could use for a minimal rental fee.A few walks further, we had a view of the amazing Wawa Dam also with huts huddled close together at the foot of dam looking similar to the luncheon scene at Villa Escudero. Later on the trip we would hike down to get close to the dam but we continued following the trail to the dam’s reservoir.On our way to the reservoir, we walked pass by some cave entrances along the trail and walked pass through two tunnels carved out from the limestone wall until we reached the dam’s observation deck.

                          From the abandoned observation deck, we had spectacular views of the majestic gorge, the gorgeous upper lake and the dam below that spans across the narrow chasm.The height of the deck from the lake below is a dizzying three-storey vertical drop but Howie Severino made history recently perhaps to be the first journalist and blogger to have jumped off from the deck’s ledge into the lake. It may be a feat for Howie but for a local group of children, diving off from the observation deck is part of their swimming routine in Wawa Dam.We crossed the iron bridge that connects the observation deck to the lakeshore. At the lakeshore, we found more huts this time filled with families having picnic, friends exchanging stories, and even a group singing their hearts out around a videoke!  

                          We were so excited to take a plunge into the lake but we realized that we did the most unforgivable thing we’ve ever done for this trip of forgetting our bathing suit or at least to bringing extra clothes and missing the chance to go for a swim into the cold water. Wawa Dam ceased operation in the 1960’s when the Ipo-La Mesa-Angat watershed was established. Since its decommissioning, the dam’s lower river and upper lake were frequented by local tourists and campers for its ethereal beauty and extremely cheap almost free accomodation.The dam is like a more rustic version of the man-made falls of the popular Villa Escudero. Although the trip down to the picnic site close to foot of the dam is arduous but it cost practically nothing to enjoy the man-made falls. The water pouring from the reservoir in the upper lake to the dam wall and the gurgling water around the primordial rock boulders on the river provide a refreshing treat to the senses and to the spirit.But the dam is far from amusing. It has a grim history. The locals believe that its nangunguha, it summarily takes a human life. Its victims were usually first born males. Survivors claimed that a strong force was pulling them down while swimming even on shallow parts of the river. 

                          A local television documentary named the supernatural force as Pandora, a river fairy who has been raped by a mortal and has sought revenge by drowning her victims. Tired and thristy, we rested in one of the bamboo stalls selling sweet turon and ice-cold samalamig along the side of the trail. We asked the tindera about the Pamitinan Cave. She pointed at the limestone wall across her stall where two caves are visible from her stall’s window.

                          A year before the start of the 1896 Revolution, Andres Bonifacio with eight men fled to the mountains of Montalaban, to Pamintinan Cave on a Good Friday. Bonifacio inscribed on the cave wall what could have been the first cry of Philippine Independence. According to the local tourism office, the cave wall still bears the inscription Viva la Independencia Filipinas!The Pamintinan Cave is just one of the several cave systems in the Montalban Gorge. Other caves are said to be where the Japanese soldiers have retreated and spent their last defense during the final days of World War II. A marker by the cave entrance is visible from the trail. Guided tours into the caves are arranged at the Montalban Tourism Office.',

                           'blog' => 'It is a National Park but sad to say, this natural beauty was not properly valued. I was already warned by my aunt about the environmental damage it has undergone due to the carelessness of the inhabitants near it. Yet I still wanted to go and see for myself so I got prepared for the stench (as most feedbacks say it has). 

                            It was a long journey to the location and upon arriving, I had the first impression of “dilapidation”. It was in seclusion and I can imagine an eerie atmosphere when evening comes. The rusty gate with the sign “Entrance Fee: 8 pesos” and the moss-covered walls welcomed us. But when I entered, nature unfolded. I heard the faint sound of the falls, but to my surprise, I could smell no stench at all. As I descended on a flight of stairs, the ‘ssshh’ sound of the water falling amongst the rocks grew louder and louder. I reached the foot and the Hinulugang Taktak loomed into view...It was a beautiful site. Breath-taking! Ecstatic! 
                            The only flaw I’ve noticed is the chocolate-colored water at the base of the falls. (that reminded me of Milo or Chuckie. He-he-he) But my aunt said, maybe it was because of the hard rain on the previous day. 


                            I hope that’s true. And I hope that the people there got ‘renewed’, enlightened about its value. 
                            The Hinulugang Taktak is currently trying to recover. 

                            And this serves as our calling to fulfil our duty as nature’s ambassadors.

                           'blog' => 'I have never been to any caves at all since I started blogging about my travel experience and what made me to become interested about the caves because I have read a blog about Calinawan Cave.  This cave is situated at Tanay, Rizal, a nearby town from where I live -  Cainta.  Tanay is just one hour and a half jeepney ride from our place.  The province of Rizal was the easiest way to jaunt as it didn\'t require me to take a long trip because it\'s just a nearby town. The trip to Calinawan Cave had not required me to make plans for my itinerary ahead of time, unlike from my previous travel,  because Rizal was ideal for me as it doesn\'t involve spending too much budget nor it calls me to stay overnight.The jump-off starts from Tanay market where jeepneys and tricycle terminal is located and it begins after we took our late lunch to the market by asking the carinderia owner where we could take a ride going to Calinawan.  But beforehand I had an idea already based from what I have read from the blog as this could avoid us from overcharging the fare by some the drivers.  For a reasonable fee of 300 pesos the trike driver explained that the fee is good for two-way trip, and he had to wait for the entire journey because there’s no available trip going back to the town proper of Tanay.First we stopped to the nearby Grotto before the journey to Calinawan cave went on to the uphills and rough road until we reached Baranggay Katyo where the cave is located.  Daranak falls belongs to the same barangay and is not far away from Calinawan cave. According to the tour guide Senz, Calinawan cave is a hub for some movies like Third Eye, Dyesebel which stars Alice Dixson, Jackie Chan which I forgot the movies he mentioned to me.

                            The cave has 7 layers as our tour guide explained; the first and the second layer is easy to explore which is approximately 150 meters walk between the entrance and exit point.  The third to fifth layer is hard as it involves crawling; the sixth and the seventh layer connects to Montalban, Rizal and it takes approximately 9 days to explore.  This was an interesting story from our guide as someone made it to have reached the Montalban exit.  Calinawan cave once served as stronghold for the revolutionaries during the Spanish, American and Japanese occupation. It will take around 30-45 minutes to explore the cold cave.  Steps have to be watched carefully and it has a low ceiling through the passages.

                            My experiencing for exploring Calinawan cave gave me an opportunity to educate myself that some of the caves that have historical relevance aside from being part of the tourist attraction.  It was good to know that this openned my eyes to get to know more about some of the caves in the Philippines.',

The church always appeals me because some of them have a historical relevance attached to a place as the church exists for more than hundred years old.  As landmark to every town, the church also serves as a sign that you have gotten the place.  The gritty look of the old church reminds us that we were colonized by Spain and it was of the different orders who brought Christianity to our country.
                            I had a short trip yesterday and made a visit to St. Joseph Parish church in Baras, Rizal.  Known as Baras church by the locals, the structure was built 300 years ago.  The Franciscan built the original church in 1595.  The dimly-lit cold interior is more interesting as the hall is accented by the large golden altar of the images of saints, and the rough timber beams gave most of the rustic feel of the church.  It is vintage plain and simple, and the look has a strong character that conveys its historical background.There was a graduation event going on at the vicinity of Baras Church and what I had to do is to leave the place as early as I can.  There were vendors outside selling some foods and what caught my attention was the ice scramble as it was very hot due to summer season.Going to Baras Church is easy and you can take jeepneys bound for Tanay, Rizal.  Ask the driver to drop you off to the Municipal Hall and a 5-minute walk uphill to the church.  Travel time depends on where you came from.  From Cainta, Ortigas extension, it’s more or less one and a half travel time if you are taking a jeepney ride.',
